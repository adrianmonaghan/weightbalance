# Helicopter Weight and Balance

This program creates a local website using Flask that allows a user to calculate the weight and balance of a specific Robinson R44 Raven I Helicopter. It then plots the data on an image of the actual weight and balance chart from the R44 Raven I Pilot's Operating Handbook.
There are still many features that I would like to implement.:
- Calculating and plotting performance data
- Use the NWS's API to determine weather at a given location and use that information to make performance calculations
- Allow for the creation of different aircraft with different empty weights and moments and store the information in a database to later be accessed
- Allow for the option to store specific weight and balance along with performance calculations in a databse with specific date and time information so that it can be referenced at a later time for planning as well as in case for any reason, proof has to be shown that the weight and balance was calculated before the flight
